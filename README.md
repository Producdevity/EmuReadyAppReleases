# EmuReady Lite — Android App Releases

[![GitHub downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Producdevity/EmuReadyLite/total.svg)](https://github.com/Producdevity/EmuReadyLite/releases)

## Overview

EmuReady Lite brings the EmuReady compatibility database to Android with a touch-first experience. Browse handheld and PC compatibility reports, follow trending reports and emulators, and keep your watchlist synced while you’re away from your PC.

> **EmuReady Lite is available for everyone to sideload and on its way to be released for free on the Google Play Store.**
>
> This app is a **free stable version** for people who want the comfort of EmuReady on their phone without the latest experimental features. Selected capabilities that graduate from beta will arrive in **EmuReady Lite**, while premium early-access tooling remains in **EmuReady Beta** to keep the project sustainable.

> **Note:** EmuReady Lite does _not_ include early-access features such as the Setup Wizard or the Launch Tool that can boot games directly into supported emulators like Eden and GameNative.

[![GitHub downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Producdevity/EmuReadyAppReleases/total.svg)](https://github.com/Producdevity/EmuReadyAppReleases/releases)

## Overview

The EmuReady App brings the EmuReady compatibility database to Android with a touch-first experience. Browse handheld and PC compatibility reports, follow trending reports and emulators, and keep your watchlist synced while you’re away from your PC.

> **EmuReady is available for everyone to sideload and available on the Google Play Store.**
>
> This app is a **free stable version** for people who want the comfort of EmuReady on their phone without the latest experimental features. Selected capabilities that graduate from **EmuReady Beta** will arrive in **EmuReady**.

> **Note:** The EmuReady App does _not_ include early-access features such as the Setup Wizard or the Launch Tool that can boot games directly into supported emulators like Eden and GameNative.
